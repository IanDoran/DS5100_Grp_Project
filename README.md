# DS5100_Grp_Project
Repository for files related to our DS5100 group project.


Below are the guidelines for the group project:
  Taken from module 0.4 on Collab
  
Project Specifications:
1. Self-organize into groups of 4 students
2. Pick a data set that you and your group find interesting. (Example source: UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. Feel free to select your data from any other source as appropriate. See Semester Project Resources for additional locations for datasets.)
3. Form a research question
4. Perform data pre-processing, data cleaning, outlier removal, and so on to sanitize your data as necessary.
5. Save your data in a .csv file (or other format as appropriate for your data set and project scenario).
6. Read in data to your program from the data file.
7. (Optional - do as appropriate) Process the data or perform any calculations or statistics on it before storing the data into a data frame (see next step).
8. Save the data into one or more data frames (or other structures as appropriate)
9. Once you have stored your data, explore your data to reveal interesting/useful information based on your project scenario.
10. Query your data using at least four (4) different queries (questions). You can certainly have more than four questions
11. Write at least two (2) unit tests. For example, these might be short tests to show that two different functions work as intended. Did you test your code in other ways? If so, include what testing activities you carried out in your presentation/report.


2. PRESENTATION

Each group will give a presentation not to exceed 10 minutes
The presentation should briefly include:
- research question
- data summary
- data processing methodology
- visualizations
- results
- conclusions
The presentation file format should be PowerPoint (PPTX) or PDF
The file name should begin with GroupName[n] where [n] is your group number.  For example: Data Wizards[7].pdf
Be sure to practice beforehand, and time yourselves. All members of the group must participate in the presentation. How you divide up the work, however, is entirely up to your group! 


3. CODE

Clearly document (clear header and code includes comments), organize, and name your code file or files
The files can be in Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts (or a combination)


Submission:
In one Zip file submit through Collab: (1) written report; (2) presentation (e.g. PDF or PowerPoint PPTX); (3) code files; and (4) [optional but recommended] a README.txt file describing the items in your ZIP file, especially if you have multiple code files and/or other included files.

Presentation skills:

All group members were present and spoke
The live session presentation was 10 minutes or         20
less (not shorter than 7 minutes)
The presentation was of good quality, organized, 
and easy to understand
